## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Load packages, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(broom)
library(cowplot)
library(agricolae)
library(phyloseq)
set.seed(7)
```
