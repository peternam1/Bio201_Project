## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Load packages, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}

## Assumptions & T Test for HiMaize, HiMaize+BRMPS, Inulin, LOODAT


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

# check variances

         y = HiMaize_weekly$week3, 
         alternative = "two.sided") # p=0.1558, variances are equal

# run the t test # non-normal, equal variances, use wilcoxon test

            y = HiMaize_weekly$week3, 
            alternative = "less", paired = TRUE, var.equal = TRUE)

#the p value for the wilcoxon is 0.01215, which is less than 0.05 and thus rejects the null that the propionate concentration for week 1 and week 3 are not the same.

# non-normal, equal variances, use wilcoxon test

#the p value for the wilcoxon is 0.9937, which is larger than 0.05 and fails to reject the null. The propionate concentration for week 1 and week 3 are the same.

# non-normal, equal variances, use wilcoxon test 
Inulin_weekly <- na.omit(Inulin_weekly)

            y = Inulin_weekly$week3,

#the p value for the wilcoxon is 0.2978, which is larger than 0.05 and fails to reject the null. The propionate concentration for week 1 and week 3 are the same.

# non-normal, equal variances, use wilcoxon test

            y = LOODAT_weekly$week3,

#the p value for the wilcoxon is 0.9123, which is larger than 0.05 and fails to reject the null. The propionate concentration for week 1 and week 3 are the same.

# so only Hi_Maize shows significant difference for propionate concentration.
```
## Is other SCFA also changed according to the supplement?

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}


```
## delta changes

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
HiMaize_weekly_delta <- HiMaize_weekly %>% 
mutate(delta_propionate = week3 - week1) 
#U043, #0U52 #0U57 #U369 #U377 #U379 #U382 #U387 #U388 #U390 #U392


species_avg <- read_delim(file = "final_project_data/species_avg_shared.txt",
                        delim = "\t", col_names = TRUE, trim_ws = TRUE, 
                        na = c("", "NA")) 
#U52:Ana

```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
