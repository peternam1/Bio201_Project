```{r}
# sample size of each group
scfa_weekly %>% 
  filter(supplement_consumed == "Accessible") %>% 
  summarize(sample_size = n()) # week1 n=31 & week3 n=32, not use the NA 
scfa_weekly %>% 
  filter(supplement_consumed == "Arabino") %>% 
  summarize(sample_size = n()) # week1 n=17 & week3 n=13, not use the NA - WILCOX
scfa_weekly %>% 
  filter(supplement_consumed == "BRMPS") %>% 
  summarize(sample_size = n()) # week1 n=151 & week3 n=151, not use the NA 
scfa_weekly %>% 
  filter(supplement_consumed == "BRMPS+Accessible") %>% 
  summarize(sample_size = n()) # week1 n=17 & week3 n=16, not use the NA - WILCOX

# check normality of each group
shapiro.test(Accessible_weekly$week1) 
ggplot(Accessible_weekly, aes(x = week1)) + geom_histogram() # p=0.001208, skewed to the right -> not normal 
shapiro.test(Accessible_weekly$week3) 
ggplot(Accessible_weekly, aes(x = week3)) + geom_histogram() #p=0.0006834, skewed to the right -> not normal

shapiro.test(Arabino_weekly$week1) 
ggplot(Arabino_weekly, aes(x = week1)) + geom_histogram() # p=0.01328, skewed to the right -> not normal 
shapiro.test(Arabino_weekly$week3) 
ggplot(Arabino_weekly, aes(x = week3)) + geom_histogram() # p=  0.5143, sort of normal shaped -> normal

shapiro.test(BRMPS_weekly$week1) 
ggplot(BRMPS_weekly, aes(x = week1)) + geom_histogram() # p=6.225e-06, bimodal and skewed to the right -> not normal
shapiro.test(BRMPS_weekly$week3) 
ggplot(BRMPS_weekly, aes(x = week3)) + geom_histogram() # p=1.357e-09, skewed to the right -> not normal

shapiro.test(BRMPS_Accessible_weekly$week1) 
ggplot(BRMPS_Accessible_weekly, aes(x = week1)) + geom_histogram() # p=0.202, sort of bimodal and very spread out
shapiro.test(BRMPS_Accessible_weekly$week3) 
ggplot(BRMPS_Accessible_weekly, aes(x = week3)) + geom_histogram() # p=0.02685, skewed to the right -> not normal

# check variances
var.test(x = Accessible_weekly$week1, 
         y = Accessible_weekly$week3, 
         alternative = "two.sided") # p=0.2249, variances are equal
var.test(x = Arabino_weekly$week1, 
         y = Arabino_weekly$week3, 
         alternative = "two.sided") # p=0.6808, variances are equal

# run the t test
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
