#violin plot = to check whether or not the proprionate levels changed from week1 to week3, and to check how different the two semesters were. The two semesters looked very different, which could explain why our data looks very random and we found no correlelation. Each semester contains very different microbiomes, all that change in different ways in response to the supplement.
